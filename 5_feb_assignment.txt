1) In python everything is a object like variable, function , class . 
class is a blueprint for creating objects. 

2) Four pilars of OOPS are,
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction 

3) __init__() is a constructor ,eg. It is used while taking input parameters to the class.
eg. 
class pwskills:
    def __init__(self, phone_number, email, student_id):
        self.phone_number = phone_number 
        self.email = email 
        self.student_id = student_id 
    def return_student_details(self):
        return self.phone_number, self.email, self.student_id 
rohan = pwskills(898, "dsad", 2312)
print(rohan.phone_number)

4)'self' is a pointer used to point funtion objects in a class. 

5) Inheritance , allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. 
Type of inheritance and example are, 
Single Level Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, Hierachical Inheritance, Hybird Inheritance.
