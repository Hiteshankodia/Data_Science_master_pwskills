    "In Python, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It indicates that something went wrong during the program's execution. Exceptions are a way to handle errors and unexpected conditions in a controlled manner, allowing the program to continue running or terminate gracefully.\n",

    "Aspect\tExceptions\tSyntax Errors\n",
    "Definition\tExceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program.\tSyntax errors are mistakes in the structure of the code that prevent it from being parsed.\n",
    "Occurrence\tExceptions occur during the execution of a program, often due to invalid operations or conditions.\tSyntax errors occur when the Python interpreter cannot parse the code because it does not conform to the language's rules.\n",
    "Detection\tDetected during program execution.\tDetected during the compilation or parsing stage before execution begins.\n",
    "Example\tTrying to divide by zero (10 / 0) or accessing an undefined variable.\tMissing a colon (if x > 5 print(x)) or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "Handling\tCan be handled using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\tMust be corrected in the code before execution.\n",
    "Impact\tCan be caught and managed to prevent the program from crashing.\tPrevents the code from running at all until corrected.\n",
    "Example Code\tpython try: \\n result = 10 / 0 \\n except ZeroDivisionError: \\n print(\"Error!\")\tpython if x > 5 print(x) \\n # Missing colon will cause a SyntaxError"
